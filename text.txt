EdgeX API is a set of APIs provided by EdgeX Foundry, an open-source IoT platform that provides a framework for building industrial IoT edge computing systems. The EdgeX API includes various microservices such as Core Data Service APIs, Meta Data Service APIs, and Device Service APIs. These APIs can be used to access and manipulate data collected by devices and sensors, as well as to manage the devices themselves. The EdgeX API is based on REST API and EdgeX convention, and it can be accessed using HTTP requests. The API Gateway is used to access EdgeX REST resources. The EdgeX API can be used by developers to build custom applications that interact with EdgeX microservices.
