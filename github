steps to create github account
Go to the GitHub website: https://github.com/
Click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the page.
On the next page, you will be prompted to enter your username, email address, and password. Choose a username that you like, and make sure the email address you provide is valid.
Once you have entered your details, click on the "Create account" button.
GitHub will now ask you to choose a plan. You can choose between a free plan and a paid plan. If you are just getting started with GitHub, the free plan should be sufficient.
After choosing your plan, you will be asked to complete a short survey about your experience with coding. You can choose to skip this step if you prefer.
You will now be prompted to verify your email address. Check your email inbox for a message from GitHub, and follow the instructions to verify your email.
Once your email is verified, you can start using your GitHub account.
