The "Generate Telemetry Data" inject node triggers the flow every 2 seconds to generate random telemetry data.
The "Generate Random Telemetry Data" function node creates random values for temperature and humidity and formats them as a JSON object.
The "Azure IoT Hub" node (connected to the "Generate Random Telemetry Data" node) sends the telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.
The "Azure IoT Hub" node (connected to the "Telemetry Data" chart node) retrieves the telemetry data from Azure IoT Hub.
The "Telemetry Data" chart node displays the received telemetry data on the Node-RED dashboard.
The "Azure IoT Hub" node (connected to the "Temperature" gauge node) retrieves the telemetry data from Azure IoT Hub.
The "Temperature" gauge node displays the temperature value on the Node-RED dashboard.
The "Azure IoT Hub" node (connected to the "Humidity" gauge node) retrieves the telemetry data from Azure IoT Hub.
The "Humidity" gauge node displays the humidity value on the Node-RED dashboard.
Ensure you have the necessary Azure IoT Hub and Node-RED configurations set up, including installing the required Node-RED nodes (e.g., node-red-contrib-azureiothub and node-red-dashboard).
