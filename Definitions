Remote diagnosis allows you to connect to an edge device, such as a server or a computer, using SSH (Secure Shell) or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for troubleshooting and diagnosing issues remotely. Here's a brief explanation of both methods:

SSH (Secure Shell): SSH is a secure network protocol that enables secure remote access and control of a device over an encrypted connection. To remotely diagnose an edge device using SSH, you typically need an SSH client installed on your local machine. Once you have the SSH client, you can establish an SSH connection to the edge device by specifying its IP address or hostname, along with valid credentials. This allows you to access the command-line interface of the device remotely and perform various diagnostic tasks, such as running commands, analyzing logs, and troubleshooting issues.

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft for remote desktop access. It allows you to connect to a Windows-based edge device and control it remotely as if you were sitting in front of it. To diagnose an edge device using RDP, you need an RDP client installed on your local machine. Once you have the RDP client, you can provide the IP address or hostname of the edge device, along with valid credentials, to establish an RDP session. This enables you to see and interact with the desktop environment of the device, access files and applications, and perform diagnostic tasks directly on the device.

When using SSH or RDP for remote diagnosis, it's important to ensure that you have proper network connectivity between your local machine and the edge device. You also need to have the necessary credentials (username and password or SSH keys) to authenticate and establish a secure connection.
